        <h3> Why Programming?</h3>
        <p>  I've always loved technology from an early age, however I never thought I could pursue a career in it. Although it fascinated me, it never occured to me that the computers and their programs were made by everyday people. I thought they were made by geniuses and so complex that i'd never learn anything of value. But I was wrong! </p>
        <br>
        <p> The first time i'd ever heard of computer programming was because i took a course in community college (completely by accident by the way). I didnt get it and I'm not even sure how I passed, but after that i decided it wasn't for me. However, Last year I stumbled upon a python and javascript course through EDX. I decided to give it a shot because the Covid-19 pandemic had started and I was bored. It was free but i loved it so much i purchased the extended version. I stayed up late nights and early mornings to learn and develop my skills. I started making simple websites on my local machine until the python portion made more sense and i learned how to use the MVC Django </p>

        <h3> inspiration </h3>
        <p> I'm sure you can tell by looking at this website that I was heavily inspired by some of my favorite videogames and game systems from my childhood. The first thing i ever wanted to do on my school computer was navigate to an unblocked gaming website and mess around when the teacher wasn't looking! One day i hope to create my own game or maybe contribute to a larger one. </p>
